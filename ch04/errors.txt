(U) Pg. 100 Listing 4-2 shows package resource definitions appearing as
the result
of running 'puppet resource service'. Are we supposed to do anything
with these definitions?

(U) Pg. 100 In Listing 4-2 why aren't standard 'yum install' or
'service' commands used?

(U) Pg. 101 How is a reader supposes to know what an NPM provider or RVM is?

(T) Pg 101 "Often installing Passenger" ->
"Often, installing Passenger"

(T) Pg 103 "will consume some time is to run" ->
"will consume some time to run"

(T) Pg. 103 "facter fqdn." ->
"facter fqdn"

(T) Pg. 103 "Pro-puppet-master-centos-II" ->
"pro-puppet-master-centos-II"

(E) Pg. 103 "stored in the environment as a standard environment
variable" ->
"stored in a standard environment variable"

(T) Pg. 105 "ServerName attribute of" ->
"ServerName attribute in"

(C) Pg. 106 You should mention that the notice about installing Emacs
is just an example. New readers might think that they should see this
exact line.

(U) Pg. 108 Figure 4-1 looks like there are 3 machines behind the load
balancer,
but the Note makes it clear that there is really just 1 machine there.

(E) Pg. 111 "the puppet user, as this parameter decides" ->
"the puppet user since this determines"

(E) Pg. 111 "sure to modify" ->
"sure to replace"

(C) Pg. 111 "Step 3" vs. "four lines". You should decide on a convention
for including numbers in text. Either they should be all numeric (e.g.
3, 4) or all text (e.g. three, four).

(E) Pg. 111 "Pass the request along" ->
"Pass the request"

(M) Pg. 111, 112 There are 3 places that the front-end load balancer
configuration
file is mentioned, saying that it appears in Listing 4-14. This actually
appears in Listing 4-13.

(E) Pg. 111 "are listed, port 18140 and 18141" ->
"are listed, running on ports 18140 and 18141"

(T) Pg. 112 "look to" ->
"look at"

(T) Pg. 112 "mail.pro-puppet..com" ->
"mail.pro-puppet.com"

(T) Pg. 112 "back- end" ->
"back-end"

(E) Pg. 112 "HTTP systems" ->
"HTTP servers"

(T) Pg. 113 "logged into" ->
"logged in"

(E) Pg. 115 "is also available" ->
"also appears"

(T) Pg. 115 "let's bring back both workers back online" ->
"let's bring both workers back online"

(E) Pg. 120 "Use the puppet agent command to generate a certificate" ->
"Use the puppet agent command to generate a certificate signing request"
(The title for List 4-34 also needs to be modified). (This is correct on
Pg 124).

(E) Pg. 121 "used the ls utility" ->
"used ls"

(E) Pg. 122 "with a single thread" ->
"with a single core"

(M) Pg. 123 "which were defined in Listing 4-38" ->
"which were defined in Listing 4-37"

(C) Pg. 126 "First, remove the ssl/ca directory on the secondary CA server"
This step isn't necessary if you use the -a option to rsync, which makes
the destination an exact copy of the source.

(E) Pg. 127 "a one-minute cron job" ->
"a cron job that runs every minute"

(C) Pg. 127 The font used in the paragraph starting "This uses the rsync
utility" is wrong.
It's using the console font from from the "crontab -l" example.

(E) Pg. 128 "we get a test run as shown" ->
"we make a test run as shown"

(T) Pg. 130 "You performed twosimple" ->
"You performed two simple"

(M) Pg. 130 "We could also use DNS round robin to easily redirect
and consolidate all certificate requests to a single Puppet CA worked".
This is exactly the opposite of what DNS round robin does. It's odd
that this mistake exists here since the following paragraph explains DNS
round robin correctly.

(E) Pg. 130 "a portion of the Puppet agent systems" ->
"some Puppet agents"

(E) Pg. 131 "As in our HTTP load balancing" ->
"As in HTTP load balancing"

(E) Pg. 131 "the Puppet agent supports the configuration of a Puppet CA
server" ->
"the Puppet agent can be configured to use a Puppet CA server"

(U) Pg. 131 "The Puppet agent configuration should set the --ca_server
configuration option"
How? Does this go in puppet.conf where the other configuration options go?
If so, why is the option name shown with the '--' characters?

(E) Pg. 131 "written down in puppet.conf" ->
"specified in puppet.conf"

(T) Pg. 131 I see both "HA proxy" and "HA-proxy" used. However,
according to http://haproxy.1wt.eu, its name is "HAproxy".
This needs to be corrected in many places in the rest of this chapter.

(T) Pg. 131 "impenetrable to the HA proxy" ->
"impenetrable to HAproxy"

(U) Pg. 131 "populating client configs to set the caserver configuration
option"
In addition to the awkward wording, it isn't clear how to set the
caserver option. Also,
is this the same --ca_server option I mentioned above?

(U) Pg. 134 What does it mean to "segment" a Puppet infrastructure?

(U) Pg. 134 What does running a "load-balancing virtual IP" mean?

(T) Pg. 134 "to speak" ->
"that speaks"

(E) Pg. 134 "The Linux machine uses a BGP or OSPF or other routing
protocol link" ->
"The machine running Quagga uses a routing protocol link"

(U) Pg. 134 The paragraph explaining anycast is extremely unclear.

(E) Pg. 134 "and local code" ->
"and local Puppet manifests"

(U) Pg. 135 What does it mean that the Git directories "pollute" the
structure shown?

(U) Pg. 137 The sentence mentioning facts_format and facts_query
has no value because these two parameters don't actually appear in
Listing 4-68.

(E) Pg. 138 "the systems may start to thrash" ->
"it may start to thrash"

(E) Pg. 138 "The Example.com operator" ->
"Example.com"
