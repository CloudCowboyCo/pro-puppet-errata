Pg 279

Listing 12.52 The modules /openvpn/manifests/init.pp file

file { '/etc/openvpn/openvpn.crt' :
   ensure   => present,
   content  => template('openvpn.crt'),
}

file { '/etc/openvpn/openvpn.key' :
   ensure   => present,
   content  => template('openvpn.key'),
}

Should be:

file { '/etc/openvpn/openvpn.crt' :
   ensure   => present,
   content  => hiera('openvpn.crt'),
}
file { '/etc/openvpn/openvpn.key' :
   ensure   => present,
   content  => hiera('openvpn.key'),
}
